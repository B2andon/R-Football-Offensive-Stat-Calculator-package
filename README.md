# R-Football-Offensive-Stat-Calculator-package
This package was designed to give the user ease of access to calculate many of the major statlines within the NFL for offensive skill positions such as receiver, quarterback and running back. 
The purpose of this being designed as such is to allow the user to import the package, type one of the following three commands

qbgetstats()
rbgetstats()
wrgetstats()

and compute many of the major statlines, such as yards per attempt, qb efficiency, catching efficiency, yards per rush attempt, yards per reception, and qb rating.

this package is still a work in progress, and will most likely be added into an even more complex package in the future, adding even more in depth statistics such as defensive stats, defensive efficiency, turnover rates, and much more. 

As of 4/24/21 this skill-position stat calulation package is ready to use.

To test some basic stats with this package, you can find statlines to try out on the nfl.com website, found further on https://www.nfl.com/stats/player-stats/ using the Passing, Rushing and Receiving categories.
